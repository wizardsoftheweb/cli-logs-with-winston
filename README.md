## Usage

### API

## Scope?

Polluting the global namespace is generally considered a bad idea, so why would you do it on NPM?

## Roadmap

These percentages are pretty arbitrary. Today's 47% could be tomorrow's 90% or vice versa.

### Main Features

Once all of these are finished, I'll release `v1`. Until then, `v0` should be used with caution, because it's not stable.

| Progess | Feature |
| ------: | ------- |
|    100% | Add bin script |
|     80% | Test |
|     90% | Export the full namespace |
|     90% | Compile declaration file |
|      0% | Write docs |
|      0% | Publish package on `npm` |

### Eventual features

These are things I'd like to add, but probably won't be included in `v1`. If not, they'll most likely constitute one or more minor version increments.

| Progess | Feature |
| ------: | ------- |
|      0% | [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/) (or similar) integration |
|      0% | Create examples|
|      0% | Containerize examples|
